# Not AbstractText

This is a fork of the [AbstractText][] extension
whose only purpose is to hold the objects of the “eneyj” sub-component
while they are being migrated towards the [Wikifunctions function model][],
which differs from the original model in several important aspects.
The objects are used by [GraalEneyj][],
and the contents of this repository will evolve along with GraalEneyj,
until the migration to the Wikifunctions function model is complete,
at which point this repository will no longer be needed.
